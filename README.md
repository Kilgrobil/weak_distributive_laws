# Powerset weakly distributes over itself in toposes

This file is an appendix of the PhD thesis of Alexandre Goy:
**On the Compositionality of Monads via Weak Distributive Laws** (2021) 
It contains formal proofs, valid in the category of sets and more generally in any topos, that: 
  - ```Theorem eta_nearly_cartesian```  
    The unit of the powerset monad is nearly cartesian iff the topos is degenerate
  - ```Theorem mu_nearly_cartesian```  
    The multiplication of the powerset monad is nearly cartesian
  - ```Theorem monotone_weak_dlaw```  
    The unique monotone weak distributive law from the powerset over itself
    is given by the expected formula, derived from Egli-Milner
  - ```Theorem dlaw_degenerate```  
    If there is a distributive law ```PP -> PP``` then the topos is degenerate
